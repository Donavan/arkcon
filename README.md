# Arkcon

This gem provides access to the API exposed over RCON by *Ark: Survival Evolved* Servers.  The *Arkcon::ArkServer* class provides the API while the *Arkcon::ArkMonitor* class provides a way to receive chat and active user information in an event driven fashion.

This is under active development and should be considered unstable.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'arkcon'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install arkcon

## Usage

Instructions coming...  For now look at the apps in the bin folder or just skim the ark_server.rb file.  It's not complicated code.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
